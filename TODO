[+] add index on containedIn_id of Item
[] maybe add field routeContainer to improve speed of retrieving full tree
[] maybe faster so: 1) set all decendantsHaveSameRoute to true
2) find all items with samerouteasparent
3) for each such item set all of his ancestors's decendantsHaveSameRoute to false
This is faster if most of items have same route as parent

[] Location (as a storage) and Transport better be the same entity to reduce complexity

[] Make get_mci_info_tree take an array of id to find all mci on a whole container ship for example

[+] auto create indexes and functions with script
