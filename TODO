[] add index on containedIn_id of Item
[] maybe add field routeContainer to improve speed of retrieving full tree
[] maybe faster so: 1) set all decendantsHaveSameRoute to true
2) find all items with samerouteasparent
3) for each such item set all of his ancestors's decendantsHaveSameRoute to false
This is faster if most of items have same route as parent
